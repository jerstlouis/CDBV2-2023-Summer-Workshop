Brian Ford to Everyone	02:29 PM	So, we have some design decisions that are open and seem to be required before trying to implement, and then we have the practicality testing of implementation.  It would seem we need to tie down a few of the top level data organization things first so that teams can assist in implementation testing and feedback.  Those things would seem to center around how geo-packages are encoded and possibly reference one another, and how data is packaged in the geo-package.  Is that already clear to everyone?
Brian Ford to Everyone	02:31 PM	That wiki link is not working for me 404.
Ryan Franz (FSI) to Everyone	02:31 PM	@ford - You have to opt in on the portal
