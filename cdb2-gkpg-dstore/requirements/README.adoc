This folder contains the requirements classes.

Each file contains all requirements for a given requirement class.

NOTE: for each requirement, there should be a corresponding Abstract Test in the "abstract_tests" folder.

NOTE: sample code may reference one or more requirements and should state which requirements are included in the code by adding the following line to the Extended Description:

"#REQS: reqnum1,reqnum2,...reqnumn"
