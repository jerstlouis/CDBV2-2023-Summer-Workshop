This page lists software packages that implement OGC CDB 2.0 - Part 2: GeoPackage Data Store.

Two types of software packages are distinguished:

* Producer implementations are software products that can be used to produce CDB data stores conforming to this standard.
* Readers implementations are software products that can read CDB data stores conforming to this standard for purposes such as visualization or analytics.
